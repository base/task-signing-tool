# Base Task Signing Tool

## Quick Start

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm ci
```

2. Run the server

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Assumptions

A task directory that works with this tool must be formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD-task-name` where "task-name" can be replaced with any name. The important part is the structure of the date at the beginning of the directory name.
